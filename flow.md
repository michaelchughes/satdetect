General idea:
1. Check how many labels in file    ->      Create config file that will give details of labels
2. One label is to be trained in a supervised manner. It is the huts label here. For this label, create a cluster and get more samples that are very close to this cluster.
3. Other labels are to be learnt in a generative manner with some given cluster center 
4. Also allow a few other cluster centers

How things will be stored in files:
